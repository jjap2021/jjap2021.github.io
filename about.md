I am currently a Data Science major with a double-minor in Economics and History at Washington College in Chestertown, MD. My biggest interests in the field are Artificial Intelligence, Large Language Models, Machine Learning, and Big Data. I have extensive experience with Python (with several packages like Pandas, SciKitLearn, MatPlotLib, and more), R, and SQL which I use for both professional work, classwork, and side projects to keep me busy. Below is a description of my time these past four years:
