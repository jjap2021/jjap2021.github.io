I am a graduate from Washington College with a Bachelor's of Science in Data Science with a double-minor in Economics and History. The bulk of my coursework at college was spent around predictive models, creating data structures, and presenting findings within research.

I have extensive experience with Python (with several packages like Pandas, SciKitLearn, MatPlotLib, and more), R, and SQL which I use for professional work, classwork, and side projects to keep me busy.

### Upcoming projects:
- Time series x Baseball statistics
