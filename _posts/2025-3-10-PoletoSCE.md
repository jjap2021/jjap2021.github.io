title: Deal or No Deal and Risk Tendencies | Washington College Senior Capstone Experience
---
** THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS **

# Introduction

While in my Information Economics class, the concept of marginal utility and risk aversion was introduced and my professor had described how difficult something like this was to measure. Pretty much immediately, I thought about connecting this topic to my other class in Machine Learning and creating some model to give me a measure of one's utility. Realizing the undertaking would be a bit more than a little side project, I proposed it to my advisor, Dr. Poulsen, and we thought it would be robust enough to serve as a project I would present to the public as a culmination of what I have learned at Washington College.

# Leading up to and planning the project

In planning the methods to use in this capstone, I had weekly meetings with my advisor and a few brief meetings with professors in Economics to further explore the concept of utility. An important technique I learned was scrums and sprints, which is a framework commonly used in the computer science industry, where developers progress quickly through smaller pieces of a project in a one-to-four week segments. Though this is typically meant for development teams, I have found adapting the same sort of method in smaller one-person projects proves to be an effective way to break up work in a managable fashion.

While initially we thought about combining these economic concepts with "Who Wants to be A Millionaire?", I made the decision to pivot to "Deal or No Deal" instead because of the clearer rationale behind decisions that are made, particularly when one chooses cases as opposed to answering multiple choice questions. Here's a breakdown of the rules of "Deal or No Deal":

### What is Marginal Utility?
In a literal sense, marginal utility is the happiness (or benefit) gained from one additional unit of a good or service. This unit could be positive, negative, or neither and we'll operate here under the assumption that everyone want to maximize their utility, thus players (under the assumption of rationality) would want to have as much utility as possible. There are three different types of utility curves: risk loving, risk neutral, and risk averse. Here's what they look like graphically:

### What is Risk Aversion?
Risk aversion, in simplest terms, is one's tendency to avoid uncertainty, most commonly with finances and investing. In the work that I am doing, it would be risk aversion in regards to marginal utility and some dollar amount. In relation to marginal utility, risk aversion has to do with how much you want to take the gamble for the next unit of money (ie. $10 to $25).

# Contextualized with research

## Deal or No Deal Side

I discovered three resources, with some help from Dr. Poulsen, directly relating to Deal or No Deal and the functions of the game. The three articles analyzed three different datasets of "Deal or No Deal" and came to similar conclusions. The biggest issue, both ethically and functionally from the standpoint of the game, was that offers were substantially larger in the postgame as compared to the average of the cases left on the board.
