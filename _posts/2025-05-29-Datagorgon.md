title: Recreating the Datagorgon | A Project For A Hobby
---

The Datagorgon was a useful tool for fantasy football that combined player statistics in a way that made drafting teams easy, but it was no longer being made annually three years ago in 2022. Thus, I want to recreate it and possibly expand on what it originally did. Read this to follow along with the project and its status!

# Current phase: Planning

1. Use Sleeper's API to gather player data
2. Clean player data via Python
3. Player data to SQL Database (design pending)
4. Brief analysis for fun, but the important part is making the projecet readily available
5. Create a dashboard to present it all in a clear way

Things the Datagorgon did not have:
- In-season help (like for waivers)
- Dynasty League help (Rookie drafts and more)
- Incorperate some Machine Learning aspects
- Boom or Bust metrics
