title: Deal or No Deal and Risk Tendencies | Washington College Senior Capstone Experience
---
** THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS **

# Introduction

While in my Information Economics class, the concept of marginal utility and risk aversion was introduced and my professor had described how difficult something like this was to measure. Pretty much immediately, I thought about connecting this topic to my other class in Machine Learning and creating some model to give me a measure of one's utility. Realizing the undertaking would be a bit more than a little side project, I proposed it to my advisor, Dr. Poulsen, and we thought it would be robust enough to serve as a project I would present to the public as a culmination of what I have learned at Washington College.

In planning the methods that I would use in this capstone, I had weekly meetings with my advisor and a few brief meetings with professors in Economics to further explore the concept of utility. An important technique I learned was scrums and sprints, which is a framework commonly used in the computer science industry, where developers progress quickly through smaller pieces of a project in a one-to-four week segments. Though this is typically meant for development teams, I have found adapting the same sort of method in smaller one-person projects proves to be an effective way to break up work in a managable fashion.

- Add a piece about Risk Aversion, introduce the topic
- Add a piece about how I arrived at deal or no deal, probably should be before describing planning

# Contextualized with Research

## Deal or No Deal Side

I discovered three resources, with some help from Dr. Poulsen, directly relating to Deal or No Deal and the functions of the game.

# What The Data Tells Us

# Creating the Banker

# Simulations of Risk Aversion
