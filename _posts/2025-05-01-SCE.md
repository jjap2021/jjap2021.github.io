title: Deal or No Deal and Risk Tendencies | Washington College Senior Capstone Experience

# Introduction

When most people watch *Deal or No Deal*, they see a high-stakes guessing game with briefcases and a mysterious "Banker." But beneath the flashing lights and audience suspense lies a fascinating example of human decision-making under uncertainty. For my capstone in Data Science at Washington College, I used real game data to dig into what drives contestants' choices—and what that says about our relationship with risk.

## The Big Question: Why Do Contestants Say "Deal"?

On the surface, *Deal or No Deal* seems simple: accept the Banker’s offer, or keep playing for a potentially bigger prize. But psychology, expectations, and emotion all come into play. I wanted to explore the math behind those decisions using economic theory—specifically, *expected utility*.

Expected utility helps model how people make risky choices not just based on what’s likely to happen, but how much they *value* the outcomes. So instead of asking “how much money is this worth?” I asked, “how much happiness does this amount bring—and how much is the contestant willing to gamble for more?”

## Modeling the Banker: Beyond the Expected Value

Many assume the Banker just offers a percentage of the average remaining values on the board. Turns out, it’s more complicated than that.

I tested three main ways to model the Banker:

- **Simple Linear Regression:** Predict the offer based on the average remaining value. It explained about 76% of the variance—not bad, but not perfect.
- **Post et al. Model:** A research-based model from a 2008 economics paper (Post et al.). It assumes offers increase round by round in a predictable way. Unfortunately, this one didn’t perform well with our data (R² = 0.38).
- **Lasso Regression:** A machine learning model that zeroes out unimportant features. This model crushed the others, explaining 97% of the variance in offers with fewer, more relevant features.

So, the Banker isn’t just guessing nor being random. Their offers reflect strategy, drama, and subtle manipulation of the player.

## Measuring Risk: How Much Is a Million Dollars Really Worth?

To understand contestant decisions, I borrowed a utility function from the Post et al. paper. This function reflects *how much people value money*—and more importantly, *how that value changes as the amounts get larger*.

Contestants don’t treat a million dollars as 100 times more valuable than $10,000. Why? Because of *diminishing sensitivity*. A key insight from behavioral economics, it explains why big prizes start to feel similar at a certain point.

I took that specific version of a utility function that lets us tweak two important traits:

- **α (alpha):** Risk aversion. Low α = less risk-taking.
- **β (beta):** Diminishing sensitivity. Low β = more sensitivity to big amounts.

Using actual decisions from the show, I estimated each contestant’s α and β. Most players were moderately risk-averse with a bit of diminishing sensitivity. And when I simulated decisions using those values, the results matched up with real-world choices.

## Simulating the Game: What If You Could Re-Play Deal or No Deal a Thousand Times?

Once the models were built, I used them to simulate thousands of games. What happens if you tweak someone’s risk tolerance or sensitivity to money? Does it make them win more?

### What I found:

- Risk-averse contestants (low α) often took early offers—and usually walked away with less.
- Risk-takers (high α) stayed in the game longer and often won bigger amounts—but also risked walking away with much less.
- Contestants with higher β (less sensitivity to big money) were more likely to gamble.

In short: if you’re less afraid of risk *and* less sensitive to big prizes, you’ll probably hold out longer—and maybe win big. But you're also more likely to leave with a penny. Those who find a happy medium in risk aversion and diminishing sensitivity, are generally fair the best.

## Why This Matters (and What I Learned)

This research isn’t just about a game show—it’s about *how people make decisions*. We’re not purely rational. Our emotions, expectations, and quirks play a huge role. Understanding that helps us design better models—not just for game shows, but for many facets of life.

The next time you watch a contestant stare down the Banker’s offer, remember—it’s not just a game. It’s a psychological experiment in real-time.
